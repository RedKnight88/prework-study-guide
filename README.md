# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is a webpage using introductory HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. All notes I have from the prework of the bootcamp I'm enrolled in are stored here in a formatted, easy to understand, and easy to access page.

## Usage

Each section contains notes I have curated to refresh my understanding of different actions and components of each topic. Common phrases, patterns, and some high level concepts can be seen for each of the lessons I studied. Opening the inspector and console also allows developers to engage further with the page, in order to interact with the JavaScript behind the page. This script lists the topics again and randomly selects one to study. Overall, it is a great introduction to developing webpages in just one glance.
